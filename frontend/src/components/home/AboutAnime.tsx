                        Pokemon is a world where creatures and humans share endless adventures. 
                        Launched in 1996 by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori, its idea of capturing 
                        and battling unique monsters quickly became a global hit, expanding from 
                        games to movies.    With over 800 creatures and deep cultural impact, Pokemon
                        continues to inspire with thrilling battles and heartfelt stories that celebrate 
                        exploration and teamwork.
